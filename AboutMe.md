# "I got stars in my beard, *and I feel real weird...*"

<p> Hi! Welcome to my page! I am new to the world of programming/coding.
  At the time of writing this, I am halfway through a course on learning Java.
  
  I am brand new to the GitHub platform, 
  but hope I to find some ways to practice my coding on here!  
  *(once i figure out how to use the site, that is...)* </p>
